<h2>CANTO XIII</h2>
<br>

<p>ERE Nessus yet had reach'd the other bank,<br>
We enter'd on a forest, where no track<br>
Of steps had worn a way. &nbsp;Not verdant there<br>
The foliage, but of dusky hue; not light<br>
The boughs and tapering, but with knares deform'd<br>
And matted thick: fruits there were none, but thorns<br>
Instead, with venom fill'd. Less sharp than these,<br>
Less intricate the brakes, wherein abide<br>
Those animals, that hate the cultur'd fields,<br>
Betwixt Corneto and Cecina's stream.<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/13-135.jpg"><img alt="13-135b.jpg (50K)" src="images/13-135b.jpg" height="533" width="353"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


<br>Here the brute Harpies make their nest, the same<br>
Who from the Strophades the Trojan band<br>
Drove with dire boding of their future woe.<br>
Broad are their pennons, of the human form<br>
Their neck and count'nance, arm'd with talons keen<br>
The feet, and the huge belly fledge with wings<br>
These sit and wail on the drear mystic wood.<br>
<br>The kind instructor in these words began:<br>
"Ere farther thou proceed, know thou art now<br>
I' th' second round, and shalt be, till thou come<br>
Upon the horrid sand: look therefore well<br>
Around thee, and such things thou shalt behold,<br>
As would my speech discredit." &nbsp;On all sides<br>
I heard sad plainings breathe, and none could see<br>
From whom they might have issu'd. &nbsp;In amaze<br>
Fast bound I stood. &nbsp;He, as it seem'd, believ'd,<br>
That I had thought so many voices came<br>
From some amid those thickets close conceal'd,<br>
And thus his speech resum'd: "If thou lop off<br>
A single twig from one of those ill plants,<br>
The thought thou hast conceiv'd shall vanish quite."<br>
<br>Thereat a little stretching forth my hand,<br>
From a great wilding gather'd I a branch,<br>
And straight the trunk exclaim'd: "Why pluck'st thou me?"<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/13-137.jpg"><img alt="13-137b.jpg (52K)" src="images/13-137b.jpg" height="397" width="487"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


Then as the dark blood trickled down its side,<br>
These words it added: "Wherefore tear'st me thus?<br>
Is there no touch of mercy in thy breast?<br>
Men once were we, that now are rooted here.<br>
Thy hand might well have spar'd us, had we been<br>
The souls of serpents." &nbsp;As a brand yet green,<br>
That burning at one end from the' other sends<br>
A groaning sound, and hisses with the wind<br>
That forces out its way, so burst at once,<br>
Forth from the broken splinter words and blood.<br>
<br>I, letting fall the bough, remain'd as one<br>
Assail'd by terror, and the sage replied:<br>
"If he, O injur'd spirit! could have believ'd<br>
What he hath seen but in my verse describ'd,<br>
He never against thee had stretch'd his hand.<br>
But I, because the thing surpass'd belief,<br>
Prompted him to this deed, which even now<br>
Myself I rue. &nbsp;But tell me, who thou wast;<br>
That, for this wrong to do thee some amends,<br>
In the upper world (for thither to return<br>
Is granted him) thy fame he may revive."<br>
<br>"That pleasant word of thine," the trunk replied<br>
"Hath so inveigled me, that I from speech<br>
Cannot refrain, wherein if I indulge<br>
A little longer, in the snare detain'd,<br>
Count it not grievous. &nbsp;I it was, who held<br>
Both keys to Frederick's heart, and turn'd the wards,<br>
Opening and shutting, with a skill so sweet,<br>
That besides me, into his inmost breast<br>
Scarce any other could admittance find.<br>
The faith I bore to my high charge was such,<br>
It cost me the life-blood that warm'd my veins.<br>
The harlot, who ne'er turn'd her gloating eyes<br>
From Caesar's household, common vice and pest<br>
Of courts, 'gainst me inflam'd the minds of all;<br>
And to Augustus they so spread the flame,<br>
That my glad honours chang'd to bitter woes.<br>
My soul, disdainful and disgusted, sought<br>
Refuge in death from scorn, and I became,<br>
Just as I was, unjust toward myself.<br>
By the new roots, which fix this stem, I swear,<br>
That never faith I broke to my liege lord,<br>
Who merited such honour; and of you,<br>
If any to the world indeed return,<br>
Clear he from wrong my memory, that lies<br>
Yet prostrate under envy's cruel blow."<br>
<br>First somewhat pausing, till the mournful words<br>
Were ended, then to me the bard began:<br>
"Lose not the time; but speak and of him ask,<br>
If more thou wish to learn." &nbsp;Whence I replied:<br>
"Question thou him again of whatsoe'er<br>
Will, as thou think'st, content me; for no power<br>
Have I to ask, such pity' is at my heart."<br>
<br>He thus resum'd; "So may he do for thee<br>
Freely what thou entreatest, as thou yet<br>
Be pleas'd, imprison'd Spirit! to declare,<br>
How in these gnarled joints the soul is tied;<br>
And whether any ever from such frame<br>
Be loosen'd, if thou canst, that also tell."<br>
<br>Thereat the trunk breath'd hard, and the wind soon<br>
Chang'd into sounds articulate like these;<br>
<br>Briefly ye shall be answer'd. &nbsp;"When departs<br>
The fierce soul from the body, by itself<br>
Thence torn asunder, to the seventh gulf<br>
By Minos doom'd, into the wood it falls,<br>
No place assign'd, but wheresoever chance<br>
Hurls it, there sprouting, as a grain of spelt,<br>
It rises to a sapling, growing thence<br>
A savage plant. &nbsp;The Harpies, on its leaves<br>
Then feeding, cause both pain and for the pain<br>
A vent to grief. &nbsp;We, as the rest, shall come<br>
For our own spoils, yet not so that with them<br>
We may again be clad; for what a man<br>
Takes from himself it is not just he have.<br>
Here we perforce shall drag them; and throughout<br>
The dismal glade our bodies shall be hung,<br>
Each on the wild thorn of his wretched shade."<br>
<br>Attentive yet to listen to the trunk<br>
We stood, expecting farther speech, when us<br>
A noise surpris'd, as when a man perceives<br>
The wild boar and the hunt approach his place<br>
Of station'd watch, who of the beasts and boughs<br>
Loud rustling round him hears. &nbsp;And lo! there came<br>
Two naked, torn with briers, in headlong flight,<br>
That they before them broke each fan o' th' wood.<br>
"Haste now," the foremost cried, "now haste thee death!"<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/13-143.jpg"><img alt="13-143b.jpg (66K)" src="images/13-143b.jpg" height="394" width="494"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


The' other, as seem'd, impatient of delay<br>
Exclaiming, "Lano! not so bent for speed<br>
Thy sinews, in the lists of Toppo's field."<br>
And then, for that perchance no longer breath<br>
Suffic'd him, of himself and of a bush<br>
One group he made. &nbsp;Behind them was the wood<br>
Full of black female mastiffs, gaunt and fleet,<br>
As greyhounds that have newly slipp'd the leash.<br>
On him, who squatted down, they stuck their fangs,<br>
And having rent him piecemeal bore away<br>
The tortur'd limbs. &nbsp;My guide then seiz'd my hand,<br>
And led me to the thicket, which in vain<br>
Mourn'd through its bleeding wounds: "O Giacomo<br>
Of Sant' Andrea! what avails it thee,"<br>
It cried, "that of me thou hast made thy screen?<br>
For thy ill life what blame on me recoils?"<br>
<br>When o'er it he had paus'd, my master spake:<br>
"Say who wast thou, that at so many points<br>
Breath'st out with blood thy lamentable speech?"<br>
<br>He answer'd: "Oh, ye spirits: arriv'd in time<br>
To spy the shameful havoc, that from me<br>
My leaves hath sever'd thus, gather them up,<br>
And at the foot of their sad parent-tree<br>
Carefully lay them. &nbsp;In that city' I dwelt,<br>
Who for the Baptist her first patron chang'd,<br>
Whence he for this shall cease not with his art<br>
To work her woe: and if there still remain'd not<br>
On Arno's passage some faint glimpse of him,<br>
Those citizens, who rear'd once more her walls<br>
Upon the ashes left by Attila,<br>
Had labour'd without profit of their toil.<br>
I slung the fatal noose from my own roof."</p>

<h2>CANTO XIV</h2>
<br>

<p>SOON as the charity of native land<br>
Wrought in my bosom, I the scatter'd leaves<br>
Collected, and to him restor'd, who now<br>
Was hoarse with utt'rance. &nbsp;To the limit thence<br>
We came, which from the third the second round<br>
Divides, and where of justice is display'd<br>
Contrivance horrible. &nbsp;Things then first seen<br>
Clearlier to manifest, I tell how next<br>
A plain we reach'd, that from its sterile bed<br>
Each plant repell'd. The mournful wood waves round<br>
Its garland on all sides, as round the wood<br>
Spreads the sad foss. &nbsp;There, on the very edge,<br>
Our steps we stay'd. &nbsp;It was an area wide<br>
Of arid sand and thick, resembling most<br>
The soil that erst by Cato's foot was trod.<br>
<br>Vengeance of Heav'n! Oh! how shouldst thou be fear'd<br>
By all, who read what here my eyes beheld!<br>
<br>Of naked spirits many a flock I saw,<br>
All weeping piteously, to different laws<br>
Subjected: for on the' earth some lay supine,<br>
Some crouching close were seated, others pac'd<br>
Incessantly around; the latter tribe,<br>
More numerous, those fewer who beneath<br>
The torment lay, but louder in their grief.<br>
<br>O'er all the sand fell slowly wafting down<br>
Dilated flakes of fire, as flakes of snow<br>
On Alpine summit, when the wind is hush'd.<br>
As in the torrid Indian clime, the son<br>
Of Ammon saw upon his warrior band<br>
Descending, solid flames, that to the ground<br>
Came down: whence he bethought him with his troop<br>
To trample on the soil; for easier thus<br>
The vapour was extinguish'd, while alone;<br>
So fell the eternal fiery flood, wherewith<br>
The marble glow'd underneath, as under stove<br>
The viands, doubly to augment the pain.<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/14-147.jpg"><img alt="14-147b.jpg (53K)" src="images/14-147b.jpg" height="414" width="497"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


Unceasing was the play of wretched hands,<br>
Now this, now that way glancing, to shake off<br>
The heat, still falling fresh. &nbsp;I thus began:<br>
"Instructor! thou who all things overcom'st,<br>
Except the hardy demons, that rush'd forth<br>
To stop our entrance at the gate, say who<br>
Is yon huge spirit, that, as seems, heeds not<br>
The burning, but lies writhen in proud scorn,<br>
As by the sultry tempest immatur'd?"<br>
<br>Straight he himself, who was aware I ask'd<br>
My guide of him, exclaim'd: "Such as I was<br>
When living, dead such now I am. &nbsp;If Jove<br>
Weary his workman out, from whom in ire<br>
He snatch'd the lightnings, that at my last day<br>
Transfix'd me, if the rest be weary out<br>
At their black smithy labouring by turns<br>
In Mongibello, while he cries aloud;<br>
"Help, help, good Mulciber!" as erst he cried<br>
In the Phlegraean warfare, and the bolts<br>
Launch he full aim'd at me with all his might,<br>
He never should enjoy a sweet revenge."<br>
<br>Then thus my guide, in accent higher rais'd<br>
Than I before had heard him: "Capaneus!<br>
Thou art more punish'd, in that this thy pride<br>
Lives yet unquench'd: no torrent, save thy rage,<br>
Were to thy fury pain proportion'd full."<br>
<br>Next turning round to me with milder lip<br>
He spake: "This of the seven kings was one,<br>
Who girt the Theban walls with siege, and held,<br>
As still he seems to hold, God in disdain,<br>
And sets his high omnipotence at nought.<br>
But, as I told him, his despiteful mood<br>
Is ornament well suits the breast that wears it.<br>
Follow me now; and look thou set not yet<br>
Thy foot in the hot sand, but to the wood<br>
Keep ever close." &nbsp;Silently on we pass'd<br>
To where there gushes from the forest's bound<br>
A little brook, whose crimson'd wave yet lifts<br>
My hair with horror. &nbsp;As the rill, that runs<br>
From Bulicame, to be portion'd out<br>
Among the sinful women; so ran this<br>
Down through the sand, its bottom and each bank<br>
Stone-built, and either margin at its side,<br>
Whereon I straight perceiv'd our passage lay.<br>
<br>"Of all that I have shown thee, since that gate<br>
We enter'd first, whose threshold is to none<br>
Denied, nought else so worthy of regard,<br>
As is this river, has thine eye discern'd,<br>
O'er which the flaming volley all is quench'd."<br>
<br>So spake my guide; and I him thence besought,<br>
That having giv'n me appetite to know,<br>
The food he too would give, that hunger crav'd.<br>
<br>"In midst of ocean," forthwith he began,<br>
"A desolate country lies, which Crete is nam'd,<br>
Under whose monarch in old times the world<br>
Liv'd pure and chaste. &nbsp;A mountain rises there,<br>
Call'd Ida, joyous once with leaves and streams,<br>
Deserted now like a forbidden thing.<br>
It was the spot which Rhea, Saturn's spouse,<br>
Chose for the secret cradle of her son;<br>
And better to conceal him, drown'd in shouts<br>
His infant cries. &nbsp;Within the mount, upright<br>
An ancient form there stands and huge, that turns<br>
His shoulders towards Damiata, and at Rome<br>
As in his mirror looks. &nbsp;Of finest gold<br>
His head is shap'd, pure silver are the breast<br>
And arms; thence to the middle is of brass.<br>
And downward all beneath well-temper'd steel,<br>
Save the right foot of potter's clay, on which<br>
Than on the other more erect he stands,<br>
Each part except the gold, is rent throughout;<br>
And from the fissure tears distil, which join'd<br>
Penetrate to that cave. &nbsp;They in their course<br>
Thus far precipitated down the rock<br>
Form Acheron, and Styx, and Phlegethon;<br>
Then by this straiten'd channel passing hence<br>
Beneath, e'en to the lowest depth of all,<br>
Form there Cocytus, of whose lake (thyself<br>
Shall see it) I here give thee no account."<br>
<br>Then I to him: "If from our world this sluice<br>
Be thus deriv'd; wherefore to us but now<br>
Appears it at this edge?" &nbsp;He straight replied:<br>
"The place, thou know'st, is round; and though great part<br>
Thou have already pass'd, still to the left<br>
Descending to the nethermost, not yet<br>
Hast thou the circuit made of the whole orb.<br>
Wherefore if aught of new to us appear,<br>
It needs not bring up wonder in thy looks."<br>
<br>Then I again inquir'd: "Where flow the streams<br>
Of Phlegethon and Lethe? for of one<br>
Thou tell'st not, and the other of that shower,<br>
Thou say'st, is form'd." &nbsp;He answer thus return'd:<br>
"Doubtless thy questions all well pleas'd I hear.<br>
Yet the red seething wave might have resolv'd<br>
One thou proposest. &nbsp;Lethe thou shalt see,<br>
But not within this hollow, in the place,<br>
Whither to lave themselves the spirits go,<br>
Whose blame hath been by penitence remov'd."<br>
He added: "Time is now we quit the wood.<br>
Look thou my steps pursue: the margins give<br>
Safe passage, unimpeded by the flames;<br>
For over them all vapour is extinct."</p>

<br><br>
<a name="15"></a>
<br><br>
<h2>CANTO XV</h2>
<br>

<p>One of the solid margins bears us now<br>
Envelop'd in the mist, that from the stream<br>
Arising, hovers o'er, and saves from fire<br>
Both piers and water. &nbsp;As the Flemings rear<br>
Their mound, 'twixt Ghent and Bruges, to chase back<br>
The ocean, fearing his tumultuous tide<br>
That drives toward them, or the Paduans theirs<br>
Along the Brenta, to defend their towns<br>
And castles, ere the genial warmth be felt<br>
On Chiarentana's top; such were the mounds,<br>
So fram'd, though not in height or bulk to these<br>
Made equal, by the master, whosoe'er<br>
He was, that rais'd them here. &nbsp;We from the wood<br>
Were not so far remov'd, that turning round<br>
I might not have discern'd it, when we met<br>
A troop of spirits, who came beside the pier.<br>
<br>They each one ey'd us, as at eventide<br>
One eyes another under a new moon,<br>
And toward us sharpen'd their sight as keen,<br>
As an old tailor at his needle's eye.<br>
<br>Thus narrowly explor'd by all the tribe,<br>
I was agniz'd of one, who by the skirt<br>
Caught me, and cried, "What wonder have we here!"<br>
<br>And I, when he to me outstretch'd his arm,<br>
Intently fix'd my ken on his parch'd looks,<br>
That although smirch'd with fire, they hinder'd not<br>
But I remember'd him; and towards his face<br>
My hand inclining, answer'd: "Sir! Brunetto!<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/15-155.jpg"><img alt="15-155b.jpg (49K)" src="images/15-155b.jpg" height="405" width="493"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


"And art thou here?" &nbsp;He thus to me: "My son!<br>
Oh let it not displease thee, if Brunetto<br>
Latini but a little space with thee<br>
Turn back, and leave his fellows to proceed."<br>
<br>I thus to him replied: "Much as I can,<br>
I thereto pray thee; and if thou be willing,<br>
That I here seat me with thee, I consent;<br>
His leave, with whom I journey, first obtain'd."<br>
<br>"O son!" said he, "whoever of this throng<br>
One instant stops, lies then a hundred years,<br>
No fan to ventilate him, when the fire<br>
Smites sorest. &nbsp;Pass thou therefore on. &nbsp;I close<br>
Will at thy garments walk, and then rejoin<br>
My troop, who go mourning their endless doom."<br>
<br>I dar'd not from the path descend to tread<br>
On equal ground with him, but held my head<br>
Bent down, as one who walks in reverent guise.<br>
<br>"What chance or destiny," thus he began,<br>
"Ere the last day conducts thee here below?<br>
And who is this, that shows to thee the way?"<br>
<br>"There up aloft," I answer'd, "in the life<br>
Serene, I wander'd in a valley lost,<br>
Before mine age had to its fullness reach'd.<br>
But yester-morn I left it: then once more<br>
Into that vale returning, him I met;<br>
And by this path homeward he leads me back."<br>
<br>"If thou," he answer'd, "follow but thy star,<br>
Thou canst not miss at last a glorious haven:<br>
Unless in fairer days my judgment err'd.<br>
And if my fate so early had not chanc'd,<br>
Seeing the heav'ns thus bounteous to thee, I<br>
Had gladly giv'n thee comfort in thy work.<br>
But that ungrateful and malignant race,<br>
Who in old times came down from Fesole,<br>
Ay and still smack of their rough mountain-flint,<br>
Will for thy good deeds shew thee enmity.<br>
Nor wonder; for amongst ill-savour'd crabs<br>
It suits not the sweet fig-tree lay her fruit.<br>
Old fame reports them in the world for blind,<br>
Covetous, envious, proud. &nbsp;Look to it well:<br>
Take heed thou cleanse thee of their ways. &nbsp;For thee<br>
Thy fortune hath such honour in reserve,<br>
That thou by either party shalt be crav'd<br>
With hunger keen: but be the fresh herb far<br>
From the goat's tooth. &nbsp;The herd of Fesole<br>
May of themselves make litter, not touch the plant,<br>
If any such yet spring on their rank bed,<br>
In which the holy seed revives, transmitted<br>
From those true Romans, who still there remain'd,<br>
When it was made the nest of so much ill."<br>
<br>"Were all my wish fulfill'd," I straight replied,<br>
"Thou from the confines of man's nature yet<br>
Hadst not been driven forth; for in my mind<br>
Is fix'd, and now strikes full upon my heart<br>
The dear, benign, paternal image, such<br>
As thine was, when so lately thou didst teach me<br>
The way for man to win eternity;<br>
And how I priz'd the lesson, it behooves,<br>
That, long as life endures, my tongue should speak,<br>
What of my fate thou tell'st, that write I down:<br>
And with another text to comment on<br>
For her I keep it, the celestial dame,<br>
Who will know all, if I to her arrive.<br>
This only would I have thee clearly note:<br>
That so my conscience have no plea against me;<br>
Do fortune as she list, I stand prepar'd.<br>
Not new or strange such earnest to mine ear.<br>
Speed fortune then her wheel, as likes her best,<br>
The clown his mattock; all things have their course."<br>
<br>Thereat my sapient guide upon his right<br>
Turn'd himself back, then look'd at me and spake:<br>
"He listens to good purpose who takes note."<br>
<br>I not the less still on my way proceed,<br>
Discoursing with Brunetto, and inquire<br>
Who are most known and chief among his tribe.<br>
<br>"To know of some is well;" thus he replied,<br>
"But of the rest silence may best beseem.<br>
Time would not serve us for report so long.<br>
In brief I tell thee, that all these were clerks,<br>
Men of great learning and no less renown,<br>
By one same sin polluted in the world.<br>
With them is Priscian, and Accorso's son<br>
Francesco herds among that wretched throng:<br>
And, if the wish of so impure a blotch<br>
Possess'd thee, him thou also might'st have seen,<br>
Who by the servants' servant was transferr'd<br>
From Arno's seat to Bacchiglione, where<br>
His ill-strain'd nerves he left. &nbsp;I more would add,<br>
But must from farther speech and onward way<br>
Alike desist, for yonder I behold<br>
A mist new-risen on the sandy plain.<br>
A company, with whom I may not sort,<br>
Approaches. &nbsp;I commend my TREASURE to thee,<br>
Wherein I yet survive; my sole request."<br>
<br>This said he turn'd, and seem'd as one of those,<br>
Who o'er Verona's champain try their speed<br>
For the green mantle, and of them he seem'd,<br>
Not he who loses but who gains the prize.</p>

<h2>CANTO XVI</h2>
<br>

<p>NOW came I where the water's din was heard,<br>
As down it fell into the other round,<br>
Resounding like the hum of swarming bees:<br>
When forth together issu'd from a troop,<br>
That pass'd beneath the fierce tormenting storm,<br>
Three spirits, running swift. &nbsp;They towards us came,<br>
And each one cried aloud, "Oh do thou stay!<br>
Whom by the fashion of thy garb we deem<br>
To be some inmate of our evil land."<br>
<br>Ah me! what wounds I mark'd upon their limbs,<br>
Recent and old, inflicted by the flames!<br>
E'en the remembrance of them grieves me yet.<br>
<br>Attentive to their cry my teacher paus'd,<br>
And turn'd to me his visage, and then spake;<br>
"Wait now! our courtesy these merit well:<br>
And were 't not for the nature of the place,<br>
Whence glide the fiery darts, I should have said,<br>
That haste had better suited thee than them."<br>
<br>They, when we stopp'd, resum'd their ancient wail,<br>
And soon as they had reach'd us, all the three<br>
Whirl'd round together in one restless wheel.<br>
As naked champions, smear'd with slippery oil,<br>
Are wont intent to watch their place of hold<br>
And vantage, ere in closer strife they meet;<br>
Thus each one, as he wheel'd, his countenance<br>
At me directed, so that opposite<br>
The neck mov'd ever to the twinkling feet.<br>
<br>"If misery of this drear wilderness,"<br>
Thus one began, "added to our sad cheer<br>
And destitute, do call forth scorn on us<br>
And our entreaties, let our great renown<br>
Incline thee to inform us who thou art,<br>
That dost imprint with living feet unharm'd<br>
The soil of Hell. &nbsp;He, in whose track thou see'st<br>
My steps pursuing, naked though he be<br>
And reft of all, was of more high estate<br>
Than thou believest; grandchild of the chaste<br>
Gualdrada, him they Guidoguerra call'd,<br>
Who in his lifetime many a noble act<br>
Achiev'd, both by his wisdom and his sword.<br>
The other, next to me that beats the sand,<br>
Is Aldobrandi, name deserving well,<br>
In the' upper world, of honour; and myself<br>
Who in this torment do partake with them,<br>
Am Rusticucci, whom, past doubt, my wife<br>
Of savage temper, more than aught beside<br>
Hath to this evil brought." &nbsp;If from the fire<br>
I had been shelter'd, down amidst them straight<br>
I then had cast me, nor my guide, I deem,<br>
Would have restrain'd my going; but that fear<br>
Of the dire burning vanquish'd the desire,<br>
Which made me eager of their wish'd embrace.<br>
<br>I then began: "Not scorn, but grief much more,<br>
Such as long time alone can cure, your doom<br>
Fix'd deep within me, soon as this my lord<br>
Spake words, whose tenour taught me to expect<br>
That such a race, as ye are, was at hand.<br>
I am a countryman of yours, who still<br>
Affectionate have utter'd, and have heard<br>
Your deeds and names renown'd. &nbsp;Leaving the gall<br>
For the sweet fruit I go, that a sure guide<br>
Hath promis'd to me. &nbsp;But behooves, that far<br>
As to the centre first I downward tend."<br>
<br>"So may long space thy spirit guide thy limbs,"<br>
He answer straight return'd; "and so thy fame<br>
Shine bright, when thou art gone; as thou shalt tell,<br>
If courtesy and valour, as they wont,<br>
Dwell in our city, or have vanish'd clean?<br>
For one amidst us late condemn'd to wail,<br>
Borsiere, yonder walking with his peers,<br>
Grieves us no little by the news he brings."<br>
<br>"An upstart multitude and sudden gains,<br>
Pride and excess, O Florence! have in thee<br>
Engender'd, so that now in tears thou mourn'st!"<br>
Thus cried I with my face uprais'd, and they<br>
All three, who for an answer took my words,<br>
Look'd at each other, as men look when truth<br>
Comes to their ear. &nbsp;"If thou at other times,"<br>
They all at once rejoin'd, "so easily<br>
Satisfy those, who question, happy thou,<br>
Gifted with words, so apt to speak thy thought!<br>
Wherefore if thou escape this darksome clime,<br>
Returning to behold the radiant stars,<br>
When thou with pleasure shalt retrace the past,<br>
See that of us thou speak among mankind."<br>
<br>This said, they broke the circle, and so swift<br>
Fled, that as pinions seem'd their nimble feet.<br>
<br>Not in so short a time might one have said<br>
"Amen," as they had vanish'd. Straight my guide<br>
Pursu'd his track. &nbsp;I follow'd; and small space<br>
Had we pass'd onward, when the water's sound<br>
Was now so near at hand, that we had scarce<br>
Heard one another's speech for the loud din.<br>
<br>E'en as the river, that holds on its course<br>
Unmingled, from the mount of Vesulo,<br>
On the left side of Apennine, toward<br>
The east, which Acquacheta higher up<br>
They call, ere it descend into the vale,<br>
At Forli by that name no longer known,<br>
Rebellows o'er Saint Benedict, roll'd on<br>
From the' Alpine summit down a precipice,<br>
Where space enough to lodge a thousand spreads;<br>
Thus downward from a craggy steep we found,<br>
That this dark wave resounded, roaring loud,<br>
So that the ear its clamour soon had stunn'd.<br>
<br>I had a cord that brac'd my girdle round,<br>
Wherewith I erst had thought fast bound to take<br>
The painted leopard. &nbsp;This when I had all<br>
Unloosen'd from me (so my master bade)<br>
I gather'd up, and stretch'd it forth to him.<br>
Then to the right he turn'd, and from the brink<br>
Standing few paces distant, cast it down<br>
Into the deep abyss. &nbsp;"And somewhat strange,"<br>
Thus to myself I spake, "signal so strange<br>
Betokens, which my guide with earnest eye<br>
Thus follows." &nbsp;Ah! what caution must men use<br>
With those who look not at the deed alone,<br>
But spy into the thoughts with subtle skill!<br>
<br>"Quickly shall come," he said, "what I expect,<br>
Thine eye discover quickly, that whereof<br>
Thy thought is dreaming." &nbsp;Ever to that truth,<br>
Which but the semblance of a falsehood wears,<br>
A man, if possible, should bar his lip;<br>
Since, although blameless, he incurs reproach.<br>
But silence here were vain; and by these notes<br>
Which now I sing, reader! I swear to thee,<br>
So may they favour find to latest times!<br>
That through the gross and murky air I spied<br>
A shape come swimming up, that might have quell'd<br>
The stoutest heart with wonder, in such guise<br>
As one returns, who hath been down to loose<br>
An anchor grappled fast against some rock,<br>
Or to aught else that in the salt wave lies,<br>
Who upward springing close draws in his feet.</p>

<br><br>
<a name="17"></a>
<br><br>
<h2>CANTO XVII</h2>
<br>

<p>"LO! the fell monster with the deadly sting!<br>
Who passes mountains, breaks through fenced walls<br>
And firm embattled spears, and with his filth<br>
Taints all the world!" &nbsp;Thus me my guide address'd,<br>
And beckon'd him, that he should come to shore,<br>
Near to the stony causeway's utmost edge.<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/17-167.jpg"><img alt="17-167b.jpg (50K)" src="images/17-167b.jpg" height="531" width="357"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


<br>Forthwith that image vile of fraud appear'd,<br>
His head and upper part expos'd on land,<br>
But laid not on the shore his bestial train.<br>
His face the semblance of a just man's wore,<br>
So kind and gracious was its outward cheer;<br>
The rest was serpent all: two shaggy claws<br>
Reach'd to the armpits, and the back and breast,<br>
And either side, were painted o'er with nodes<br>
And orbits. &nbsp;Colours variegated more<br>
Nor Turks nor Tartars e'er on cloth of state<br>
With interchangeable embroidery wove,<br>
Nor spread Arachne o'er her curious loom.<br>
As ofttimes a light skiff, moor'd to the shore,<br>
Stands part in water, part upon the land;<br>
Or, as where dwells the greedy German boor,<br>
The beaver settles watching for his prey;<br>
So on the rim, that fenc'd the sand with rock,<br>
Sat perch'd the fiend of evil. &nbsp;In the void<br>
Glancing, his tail upturn'd its venomous fork,<br>
With sting like scorpion's arm'd. &nbsp;Then thus my guide:<br>
"Now need our way must turn few steps apart,<br>
Far as to that ill beast, who couches there."<br>
<br>Thereat toward the right our downward course<br>
We shap'd, and, better to escape the flame<br>
And burning marle, ten paces on the verge<br>
Proceeded. &nbsp;Soon as we to him arrive,<br>
A little further on mine eye beholds<br>
A tribe of spirits, seated on the sand<br>
Near the wide chasm. &nbsp;Forthwith my master spake:<br>
"That to the full thy knowledge may extend<br>
Of all this round contains, go now, and mark<br>
The mien these wear: but hold not long discourse.<br>
Till thou returnest, I with him meantime<br>
Will parley, that to us he may vouchsafe<br>
The aid of his strong shoulders." &nbsp;Thus alone<br>
Yet forward on the' extremity I pac'd<br>
Of that seventh circle, where the mournful tribe<br>
Were seated. &nbsp;At the eyes forth gush'd their pangs.<br>
Against the vapours and the torrid soil<br>
Alternately their shifting hands they plied.<br>
Thus use the dogs in summer still to ply<br>
Their jaws and feet by turns, when bitten sore<br>
By gnats, or flies, or gadflies swarming round.<br>
<br>Noting the visages of some, who lay<br>
Beneath the pelting of that dolorous fire,<br>
One of them all I knew not; but perceiv'd,<br>
That pendent from his neck each bore a pouch<br>
With colours and with emblems various mark'd,<br>
On which it seem'd as if their eye did feed.<br>
<br>And when amongst them looking round I came,<br>
A yellow purse I saw with azure wrought,<br>
That wore a lion's countenance and port.<br>
Then still my sight pursuing its career,<br>
Another I beheld, than blood more red.<br>
A goose display of whiter wing than curd.<br>
And one, who bore a fat and azure swine<br>
Pictur'd on his white scrip, addressed me thus:<br>
"What dost thou in this deep? &nbsp;Go now and know,<br>
Since yet thou livest, that my neighbour here<br>
Vitaliano on my left shall sit.<br>
A Paduan with these Florentines am I.<br>
Ofttimes they thunder in mine ears, exclaiming<br>
'O haste that noble knight! he who the pouch<br>
With the three beaks will bring!'" &nbsp;This said, he writh'd<br>
The mouth, and loll'd the tongue out, like an ox<br>
That licks his nostrils. &nbsp;I, lest longer stay<br>
He ill might brook, who bade me stay not long,<br>
Backward my steps from those sad spirits turn'd.<br>
<br>My guide already seated on the haunch<br>
Of the fierce animal I found; and thus<br>
He me encourag'd. &nbsp;"Be thou stout; be bold.<br>
Down such a steep flight must we now descend!<br>
Mount thou before: for that no power the tail<br>
May have to harm thee, I will be i' th' midst."<br>
<br>As one, who hath an ague fit so near,<br>
His nails already are turn'd blue, and he<br>
Quivers all o'er, if he but eye the shade;<br>
Such was my cheer at hearing of his words.<br>
But shame soon interpos'd her threat, who makes<br>
The servant bold in presence of his lord.<br>
<br>I settled me upon those shoulders huge,<br>
And would have said, but that the words to aid<br>
My purpose came not, "Look thou clasp me firm!"<br>
<br>But he whose succour then not first I prov'd,<br>
Soon as I mounted, in his arms aloft,<br>
Embracing, held me up, and thus he spake:<br>
"Geryon! now move thee! be thy wheeling gyres<br>
Of ample circuit, easy thy descent.<br>
Think on th' unusual burden thou sustain'st."<br>
<br>As a small vessel, back'ning out from land,<br>
Her station quits; so thence the monster loos'd,<br>
And when he felt himself at large, turn'd round<br>
There where the breast had been, his forked tail.<br>
Thus, like an eel, outstretch'd at length he steer'd,<br>
Gath'ring the air up with retractile claws.<br>
<br>Not greater was the dread when Phaeton<br>
The reins let drop at random, whence high heaven,<br>
Whereof signs yet appear, was wrapt in flames;<br>
Nor when ill-fated Icarus perceiv'd,<br>
By liquefaction of the scalded wax,<br>
The trusted pennons loosen'd from his loins,<br>
His sire exclaiming loud, "Ill way thou keep'st!"<br>
Than was my dread, when round me on each part<br>
The air I view'd, and other object none<br>
Save the fell beast. &nbsp;He slowly sailing, wheels<br>
His downward motion, unobserv'd of me,<br>
But that the wind, arising to my face,<br>
Breathes on me from below. &nbsp;Now on our right<br>
I heard the cataract beneath us leap<br>
With hideous crash; whence bending down to' explore,<br>
New terror I conceiv'd at the steep plunge:<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/17-171.jpg"><img alt="17-171b.jpg (46K)" src="images/17-171b.jpg" height="529" width="354"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


For flames I saw, and wailings smote mine ear:<br>
So that all trembling close I crouch'd my limbs,<br>
And then distinguish'd, unperceiv'd before,<br>
By the dread torments that on every side<br>
Drew nearer, how our downward course we wound.<br>
<br>As falcon, that hath long been on the wing,<br>
But lure nor bird hath seen, while in despair<br>
The falconer cries, "Ah me! thou stoop'st to earth!"<br>
Wearied descends, and swiftly down the sky<br>
In many an orbit wheels, then lighting sits<br>
At distance from his lord in angry mood;<br>
So Geryon lighting places us on foot<br>
Low down at base of the deep-furrow'd rock,<br>
And, of his burden there discharg'd, forthwith<br>
Sprang forward, like an arrow from the string.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
